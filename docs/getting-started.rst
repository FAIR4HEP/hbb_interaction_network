Getting started
===============

..
        This is where you describe how to get set up on a clean install, including the
        commands necessary to get the raw data (using the `sync_data_from_s3` command,
        for example), and then how to make the cleaned, final data sets.

This guide trains an interaction network (IN) on the H->bb dataset to classify b jets. is generated by a QCD process or from a Higgs boson.

Installing
----------
Clone the hbb_interaction_network git repository and cd to it

.. code-block:: console

        git clone git@github.com:FAIR4HEP/hbb_interaction_network.git .
        cd hbb_interaction_network

Build an image from a Dockerfile accordingly.

* If you use GPU for training:

.. code-block:: console
   
   docker build -f Dockerfile.gpu .

* If you use CPU for training:

.. code-block:: console

   docker build -f Dockerfile .
